## Build

```bash
$ rebar3 compile
```

## Test
  
```bash
$ rebar3 test
```

## Use

Add the plugin to your rebar config:

```erlang
{project_plugins, [rebar3_hank]}
```

Then just call the plugin directly in an existing application:

```bash
$ rebar3 hank # orâ€¦
$ rebar3 kiwf # (Kill It With Fire)
```

This will review your project, analyzing every `*.[he]rl` file in it (optionally skipping some folders/files if you want to).
It will then apply its rules and produce a list of all the dead code that you can effectively delete.

## Certainty

In principle, Hank should have _Dialyzer_ levels of certainty. That is: if Hank points at some code, you can be **100% sure** it's _dead_.

That means that if you find some false positives (i.e. Hank pointed at some code that was not really dead / should not be deleted), **please** report it as **a bug** and we'll take care of fixing it.

## Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options in the `hank` section of `rebar.config`:

* `rules` (`[{module(), function_name()}]`):
    - This is the list of rules to apply to the analyzed code. The default rules will be defined in modules within this project, but you can define your own ones implementing the `hank_ruleset` behavior.
    - If this option is not defined, Hank will apply all the default rules.
* `ignore` (`[file:filename_all()]`):
    - List of wildcard patterns representing the files that Hank should ignore.
    - These files will not be **analyzed** and therefore they'll be entirely invisible to Hank.
    - You can also ignore a specific file adding the attribute `-format(ignore)` in it.
