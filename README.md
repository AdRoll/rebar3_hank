## Build

```bash
$ rebar3 compile
```

## Test

```bash
$ rebar3 test
```

## Use

Add the plugin to your rebar config:

```erlang
{project_plugins, [rebar3_hank]}
```

Then just call the plugin directly in an existing application:

```bash
$ rebar3 hank # orâ€¦
$ rebar3 kiwf # (Kill It With Fire)
```

This will review your project, analyzing every `*.[he]rl` file in it (optionally skipping some folders/files if you want to - see below).
It will then apply its rules and produce a list of all the dead code that you can effectively delete and/or refactor.

## Certainty

In principle, Hank should have _Dialyzer_ levels of certainty. That is: if Hank points at some code, you can be **100% sure** it's _dead_.

That means that if you find some false positives (i.e. Hank pointed at some code that was not really dead / should not be deleted), **please** report it as **a bug** and we'll take care of fixing it.

## Configuration

The plugin supports the following configuration options in the `hank` section of `rebar.config`:

* `rules` (`[hank_rule:t()]`):
    - This is the list of rules to apply to the analyzed code. Each rule is a module that should apply the `hank_rule` behavior.
    - If this option is not defined, Hank will apply all [the default rules](src/rules).
* `ignore` (`[file:filename_all() | {file:filename_all(), hank_rule:t()}]`):
    - List of wildcard patterns representing the files and rules that Hank will ignore when formatting. Tuple format is used to ignore only a specific rule in those files.
    - You can also ignore a specific file adding the attribute `-hank ignore.` to it.
    - And you can ignore specific rules adding the attribute `-hank [hank_rule:t()].` with the list of rules you want to ignore.

### Ignore specific rule items
You can even ignore specific rule items with the `-hank` attribute by giving extra _ignore specifications_ for each rule, example:
```
-hank([unused_macros,  %% Will ignore the whole rule within the module
       {unused_callbacks, cb_func_name_to_ignore}  %% Will ignore the given callback funcion name within the module
       {unnecessary_function_arguments,  %% You can give a list of multiple specs (or a single one like above)
           [{ignore_me, 2},  %% Will ignore any unused argument from `ignore_me/2` within the module
            {ignore_me_too, 3, 2},  %% Will ignore the 2nd argument from `ignore_me_too/3` within the module
            ignore_me_again]}]). %% Will ignore any unused argument from any `ignore_me_again/x` within the module (no matter the arity)
```
Refer to each rule documentation for further details.
